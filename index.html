                        What interests you in a career as a software developer?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="coding__answer coding__a1 coding__answer_show">I come from a creative background. As a kid I used to draw a lot. I studied Industrial design for 1 year before falling in love with music. I have played music professionally for many years. I am also a yoga instructor. I like technology and like the idea of being able to make web applications. I am very interested in usability and accessibility. Learning to code has been a completely new experience for me and I value that. I like learning new skills, but I can see a future and a career in web development. Even though it can be very technical, it also allows for some degree of creativity in how you can do things. I am dedicated and I pay attention to detail.  I can also see that there is a  huge potential for development and progression to different fields.</p>

                    <h3 class="coding__question coding__q2">
                        Why do you feel like Founders and Coders is the right place for you to train as a software developer?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="coding__answer coding__a2">
                        I had been learning HTML, CSS and Javascript for a few months when a friend directed me to Founders and Coders. I believe he went through the same process about 7 years ago; he recommended I look at your website and follow up with the apprenticeship.  I looked at the program and I found it was exactly what I was looking for.  other courses I was looking into were expensive and I was saving up for one of those but then with you I didn't have to wait, I could just do the projects, get in the bootcamp and go into a paid apprenticeship.

                    <h3 class="coding__question coding__q3">
                        Tell us something you struggled with during the application. How did you find help?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="coding__answer coding__a3">
                        I have struggled with a lot of things, e.g. writing code, setting up github, using the terminal, you name it. My housemate is a web developer and he helps me and encourages me at times. The web is incredibly useful in finding information on how to perform a certain task. The meetups organised by Founders and Coders have been incredibly helpful. I have made new friends and have received help from them, but mostly being able to see that there is a community of people who are on the same path and to some extent the same level as you is relieving.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="coding__question coding__q4">
                        How will you contribute to FAC being a safe and inclusive community?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="coding__answer coding__a4">
                        There should be no space for any form of discrimination in our community. We should contribute with our actions to help people feel safe, be able to express themselves in a respectful manner, and feel valued and appreciated.

                    <h3 class="coding__question coding__q5">
                        What role do you usually take when working in a team?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="coding__answer coding__a5">
                        I have experience being a teacher, so provided I have the knowledge I am particularly good at being coach, helping team members overcome obstacles. I think I am also a good observer and can offer a neutral perspective on issues that may arise within a team, and can offer help mending relationships associated with conflict.
